# hyperskill_generating_randomness
The game where computer tries to guess user's input of '0' and '1'

At first you should train computer a little by entering the input of 100 chars.

(The funny fact: the computer doesn't use this data for training, but that's the problem of the hyperskill's project...)

Then the player inputs some sequence of '0' and '1', and the computer tries to guess it.
If computer guesses most of the chars, the player loses money.

Spoiler: the player loses money all the time... Every iteration.
